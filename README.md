# compchem
Attempting to improve my chem lab life with the help of a computer.

Like what I do on a day-to-day basis, this place would be full of experiments. Some of them could be actual computational chemistry stuff, but I guess I wouldn't be allowed to publish the stuff I take out from the lab here anyway, so most would be just me experimenting ways to make my life working in a chem lab easier.

(Like better ways to take notes in a group meeting, attempting to draw organic molecules in Matplotlib, etc.)
